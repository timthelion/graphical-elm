How to build:

Quick version:
elm --make -o GraphicalElm.elm
cp GraphicalElm.html build/GraphicalElm.html
open build/GraphicalElm.html

Long version:

- First you need a recentish version of the elm compiler
- Next you need to build graphical-elm:

elm --make -o GraphicalElm.elm

You will end up with a directory named "build" wherein you will find a file called GraphicalElm.js

GraphicalElm.js must be in the same folder as GraphicalElm.html.

I would sugest copying GraphicalElm.html to the build folder and then launching it there:

cp GraphicalElm.html build/GraphicalElm.html
open build/GraphicalElm.html
